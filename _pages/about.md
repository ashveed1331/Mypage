## Hi, I'm Ashveed 👋

I am a science enthusiast, currently working at **GITAM University, Bangalore**.  
I completed my Master's at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Thiruvananthapuram**.

### Interests
My research lies at the intersection of **Physics and Artificial Intelligence**. When I am not working, you can find either reading or watching sci-fi movies or playing football.  

### 🎓 Looking for PhD Positions
I am currently seeking **PhD opportunities** in the above-mentioned fields.  
If you have an opening, I would be happy to connect and discuss!
