## About Me  

Hello! I am Ashveed Ashraf, currently working as a Project Associate in the Department of Chemistry at GITAM University, Bangalore. I hold a BS–MS Dual Degree in Physics, with a minor in Mathematics, from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram (IISER TVM)](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). Prior to joining GITAM University, I was a Visiting Student at the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore.  

My primary research interests lie in theoretical physics, particularly at the intersection of Statistical Physics and Machine Learning.  

I am currently seeking **PhD opportunities** in these areas, and would be happy to connect and discuss potential openings.
